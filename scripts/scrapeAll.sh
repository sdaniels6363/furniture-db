# the purpose of this bash script is to orchestrate the running of all of the scrapes.

# drop the current collection if it exists
mongo localhost:27017/furniture --eval 'db.furniture.drop()'
# we do this everytime the script runs, this way we don't have to worry about duplicates, and we don't have to deal with adding/removing items.
