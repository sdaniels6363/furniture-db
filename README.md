# furniture-db
Full Stack Web Development - Project 3

## Purpose
This purpose of this site is to give interior designers the ability to search the inventory of multiple vendors, from a single page.  Giving them a single pane of glass experience.  This allows the user to not have to search the multiple websites of the vendors that they work with, when looking for the perfect piece of furniture for their client.

## New Technologies
For one of the vendors that we'll be using on the site, we are utilizing Python to complete the web scraping.  Python is making use of the following modules:
- requests
- bs4
- pymongo

Requests is a http request library similar to that of Axios/AJAX in Javascript.  BS4 or otherwise known as BeautifulSoup is a HTML/XML parsing library, it's similar to the cheerio module in Javascript.  Finally pymongo is the mongodb driver for python, that allows us to add records to the database, via python.
